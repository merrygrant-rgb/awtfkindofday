  “Per my last email” is not aggression.

  It’s documentation.

  And sometimes… therapy.

Every professional gets to this point eventually:

You’re not just replying anymore.
You’re ascending to a higher plane.

And we call that place:

Per my last email.

---

## Stage 1: Optimism

“Hi there! Just checking in 😊”

You still have faith.
You really think, hey, maybe they just missed it.

So you attach the file again.
Spell out the deadline, just in case.
Throw in a smiley for good measure.

You’re still soft around the edges.

---

## Stage 2: Clarification

“Just wanted to follow up on the below.”

The smiley? Gone.

Now you’re listing things:

- Asked on Monday
- Nudged on Wednesday
- Deadline’s Friday
- We are, spiritually, in limbo

You’re still polite.
But you’re hitting those keys a little harder now.

---

## Stage 3: The Shift

“Per my last email…”

There it is.

You’re not mad.
You’re not rude.
But you’ve found your inner resolve.

Now you attach the whole thread.
You highlight the line they missed.
You add timestamps for dramatic effect.

You’re not yelling.
You’re archiving.

## The Customer Service Olympics

Here's what you’re up against:

- Turning “ASAP” into an actual date
- Explaining the same thing three times, three different ways
- Writing “Happy to help!” while secretly planning your escape
- Getting a lone “?” as an entire reply

And for gold? Try explaining why you can’t break the laws of physics, policy, or federal regulations.

## A Gentle Reminder

If someone emails:

“Just a quick question…”

It will not be quick.
It will absolutely not be just one question.

You’ll need:
- context
- attachments
- and the patience of a saint

---

## Final Thought

Customer service isn’t for the faint-hearted.

It’s for:
- the organized
- the endlessly diplomatic
- the emotionally indestructible

And sometimes,
the slightly unhinged—but still professional.

If you’ve ever typed “per my last email” with the calm of a monk and the fire of a warrior—

You’re home.

These are your people.
