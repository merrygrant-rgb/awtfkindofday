There are 247 people on this email chain.

Two hundred and forty‑seven allegedly functional adults, each with a heartbeat, a Netflix subscription, and the basic literacy required to read the subject line:

**DO NOT REPLY ALL.**

It’s right there. In all caps. Practically begging.

The original message was a work of minimalist corporate poetry:

**“Parking lot will be repaved Thursday. Please use alternate entrance.”**

Clear. Simple. Emotionally neutral.

A logistical haiku.

You read it. You nodded. You moved on with your life.

Because you are a civilized human being.

And then—

**Ping.**

Accounting replies all.

**“Thanks for the update!”**

Five words. Zero necessity. Infinite consequences.

The dam cracks.

**Ping.**

“Thanks!” — Marketing, 2:03 PM

**Ping.**

“Appreciate it!” — HR, 2:04 PM

**Ping.**

“Got it, thanks!” — A contractor who hasn’t worked here since 2022 and may, in fact, be a ghost.

Your inbox becomes a live‑streamed disaster.

Your phone vibrates off the desk and begins crawling across the carpet like it’s trying to flee the scene.

Outlook starts making noises that sound like a dying Roomba.

The server is openly weeping.

Someone replies all to say **“Please remove me from this thread.”**

Someone else replies all to explain why replying all to say “don’t reply all” is the problem.

Someone re‑attaches the parking map.

Someone adds a quote about teamwork.

Someone starts a poll.

Someone reacts with a thumbs‑up emoji, which somehow triggers twelve more notifications.

And then—

At **2:47 AM**, when the world is quiet and your soul is fragile, your phone lights up.

It’s John.

From Sales.

John has just discovered the thread.

John, who believes time zones are a government conspiracy, replies all with:

**“Thx!”**

You stare at the ceiling.

You add John to your list.

Not a list you act on.

A list you *remember.*

The list you consult during performance reviews.

The list you reference when John asks for a favor.

The list that warms you like a petty little space heater.

Tomorrow, you’ll create an email rule.

Anything containing “Reply All” goes straight to the trash.

You’ll vanish.

You’ll ascend.

You’ll become a ghost in the machine.

But tonight?

You seethe.

Professionally. Quietly.

Feral.
