There is a very specific kind of rage reserved for modern warranty systems.
It begins with hope.
The manufacturer informs you — in corporate font — that only an authorized dealer may touch your vehicle.
Not your trusted mechanic.

Not the competent human down the street with tools and common sense.

No.
The dealer.
Two hours away.
In Wisconsin.
In February.
You load up like a pioneer heading west.
Snow.

Slush.

That gray sky that feels personal.

Windshield wipers performing like they’re emotionally exhausted.
Which is ironic.

Because that is the entire reason for this journey.
You drive two hours gripping the steering wheel like you’re negotiating with God.
“I am doing this the right way,” you tell yourself.
You arrive.
Cold.

Committed.

Spiritually wind-burned.
The service advisor blinks at you.
“Oh… that’s not covered under warranty.”
Silence.
You explain that the manufacturer specifically required dealership service.
He nods.
“Yes, but we actually don’t repair that here.”
Pause again.
“So what do you repair here?”
He continues.
“Also… we don’t have the part.”
Of course you don’t.
Why would you have the part?

That would imply continuity.

Preparation.

Logic.
Let’s recap.
You:


Drove four hours round trip.


Burned half a tank of gas.


Sat in a waiting room that smells like burnt coffee and lost dreams.


Followed the instructions like a responsible citizen.


And now?
You are driving home.
With the same broken wipers.
Through the same snow.
Under the same sky.
In what can only be described as corporate betrayal weather.
There is something deeply humbling about white-knuckling it through slush while your windshield performs interpretive art instead of visibility.
The dealership did not fix your wipers.
They strengthened your villain origin story.
Because the real problem was never the rubber blade.
It was the system that required obedience but offered nothing in return.
You return home.
Four hours older.
Financially lighter.
Emotionally feral.
Windshield streaked like a modern tragedy.
And as you park in your driveway, staring at the ice crust forming on glass that still does not wipe correctly, you whisper into the cold Wisconsin air:
“This was character building, wasn’t it?”
Sometimes the disaster isn’t the snow.
It’s the policy.
And today?
We chose violence against logic.
