  The Cart Abandoner

  There are two kinds of people in this world:

  Those who return their shopping cart…
  And those who set it free into the wild like it’s migrating for the winter.

  It’s not about the cart.

  It’s about what you do when no one is watching.

  And apparently… some of us need supervision.

The Cart Abandoner



There are two kinds of people in this world:



Those who return their shopping cart.



And those who release it into the parking lot like it has completed its earthly mission.



The Cart Abandoner doesn't run.



They don't scan the horizon for witnesses.



They gently detach.



A soft shove.

A spiritual shrug.



"I'll just leave it here. Someone gets paid for that."



Ah yes.



The well-known economic theory of

"Personal Responsibility Is Outsourced."



By that logic:



You could leave your coffee cup on top of the yogurt.



Abandon your jacket in produce.



Exit your vehicle mid-lot and assume destiny will parallel park it.



Someone gets paid, right?



The cart now rests diagonally across two parking spaces like a modern art exhibit titled:



"Effort Is Optional."



You pull in.



You see it.



You feel something primal rise in your chest.



Because this isn't about convenience.



It's about character when no one is grading you.



The Cart Abandoner believes society is a self-cleaning oven.



They are not evil.



They are just profoundly comfortable with being someone else's minor inconvenience.



And that, right there, is how the cracks start.



Not with corruption.



Not with scandal.



With 40 feet of walking that someone decided was too much.



Return the cart.



We are trying to build a civilization.



Or at least a parking lot that doesn't feel like a sociological experiment.
