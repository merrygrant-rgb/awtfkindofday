There is a special place in the universe for many types of people.

The optimists. The innovators. The ones who clap when the plane lands.

And then—

there is the person who uses the last of the toilet paper

and leaves

**one. single. square.**

A square so thin, so translucent, so offensively symbolic that it might as well be a Post‑it note that says:

**“Good luck, champ.”**

You walk into the bathroom unsuspecting, innocent, full of trust in humanity.

You see the roll. You think you’re safe.

You are not safe.

You pull the square.

It disintegrates on contact like it’s made of spiderwebs and regret.

This is not an accident.

This is a crime scene.

Because here’s the thing:

Replacing a toilet paper roll is not hard.

It is not a multi‑step process.

It does not require certification, training, or a union rep.

It is a tube.

On a stick.

That pops off.

And yet—

somewhere out there—

a fully grown adult looked at that cardboard tube, saw the end approaching, and thought:

**“Not my problem.”**

They didn’t even leave *two* squares.

Two squares would imply hope.

Two squares would imply effort.

Two squares would imply they at least *considered* the next human being.

But no.

They left one.

One square.

A single, mocking postage stamp of cellulose.

A square that says:

* “I believe in miracles.”
* “I refuse to acknowledge consequences.”
* “I am the main character and everyone else is an NPC.”

You sit there, staring at the empty roll like it personally betrayed you.

You reevaluate your life choices.

You consider your enemies list.

You wonder if this is how civilizations fall.

And as you perform the awkward pants‑around‑the-ankles shuffle to the cabinet where the *actual* toilet paper lives, you make a silent vow:

You will remember this.

You will not forget.

You will carry this petty injustice in your heart like a tiny, righteous flame.

Because some offenses are too small to matter

and too big to forgive.

Tonight, you will rest.

Tomorrow, you will replace the roll like the hero you are.

But you will never—

**ever**—

forget the person who left you one single square.
