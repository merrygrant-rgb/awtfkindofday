title: "“Not Today, Bill.”  -  Limited Edition It is What it Is...Cap "
type: Other
price: 28
slogan: The “Mae” was inspired by the wisest woman we know — the kind who
  doesn’t spiral, doesn’t rant, and definitely doesn’t create a 14-reply email
  chain like Bill. When things go sideways, she simply shrugs and says, “It is
  what it is,” and somehow the room recalibrates.
origin_story: Some people panic. Some people escalate. Bill schedules a meeting
  about it. Mae adjusts her crown, takes a sip of coffee, and says, “It is what
  it is.”

Not everything deserves your blood pressure.

The “Mae” isn’t about giving up — it’s about knowing what’s worth your energy and what’s just noise. Inspired by the calm in the middle of chaos, this hat is for the women (and a few evolved men) who refuse to spiral, refuse to rant, and absolutely refuse to become Bill.

Clean. Classic. Unbothered.

Wear it to the office. Wear it to the grocery store. Wear it when someone hits “Reply All.”

It’s a reminder that composure is power — and sometimes the most dominant move in the room is a quiet, “It is what it is.”
