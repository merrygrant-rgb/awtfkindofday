## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Build failed" in Netlify
**Fix:**
1. Go to Deploys tab
2. Click on the failed deploy
3. Look at the error message
4. Usually it's a typo in a post—fix it in admin panel

### "Can't log in to /admin"
**Fix:**
1. Make sure you enabled Identity in Netlify
2. Make sure you accepted the email invite
3. Try resetting your password

### "Post not showing on site"
**Fix:**
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Netlify to rebuild
2. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check that post is "Published" not "Draft"

### "Site not updating"
**Fix:**
1. In admin panel, make sure you clicked "Publish" not just "Save"
2. Check Netlify Deploys tab—should show "Published"
3. Wait a few minutes—builds take 2-3 minutes

---

## 📊 WHAT HAPPENS BEHIND THE SCENES

When you click "Publish" in admin:

```
1. Content saves to GitHub (automatically)
2. GitHub tells Netlify "something changed"
3. Netlify rebuilds your entire site (2-3 min)
4. New version goes live automatically
```

**You don't do anything!** It's all automatic.

---

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Tip 1: Save Drafts
Click "Save" instead of "Publish" to work on posts without publishing them.

### Tip 2: Preview Before Publishing
The admin panel has a "Preview" button—use it!

### Tip 3: Schedule Posts
Set the date in the future, and the post won't show until that date (but you need to set up scheduled deploys in Netlify).

### Tip 4: Backup Your Content
It's all in GitHub automatically—every change is backed up!

### Tip 5: Mobile Editing
The admin panel works on phones/tablets if you need to publish on the go.
